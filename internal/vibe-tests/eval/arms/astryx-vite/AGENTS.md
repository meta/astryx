Astryx v0.7.12 · 174 components
CLI: run every command as `npx astryx <cmd>` (shown below as `astryx ...`).

SETUP (once, in app entry e.g. main.tsx) — without these, components render unstyled:
import "@astryxdesign/core/reset.css";
import "@astryxdesign/core/astryx.css";

WORKFLOW — start every page from a template, never from scratch:

1. `astryx build "<idea>"` — names the template to scaffold from and the parts it lacks.
2. `astryx template <name> <path>` — scaffold it; keep its frame, gap and padding; replace the content.
3. `astryx template <Block>` for parts it lacks; `astryx component <Name>` to read props before using one.
   Changing an existing page? Keep it: skip step 2 and add blocks/components inside its sections.
   Before you deliver a build, run `astryx doctor --built <dir>`; don't deliver it if it fails.

RULES:

- No <div> — components handle all layout and spacing.
- Read `astryx docs layout` before changing a template's frame.
- Dense data = rows (Table, List/Item), not Card-wrapped lists. Badge = counts only.
- Style with component props first, then the xstyle prop / StyleX tokens. No raw hex/px.
- THEMES: palettes and custom colors go through the theme, never :root overrides; so does a denser or roomier app (`editor set <name> spacing tight`), never gap and padding changes page by page. No app yet: `astryx experimental theme preview app <dir>` makes a starter app that shows the theme. To make or change a theme (colors, fonts, corners, spacing, a look from a picture), prefer the experimental theme editor over hand-written theme files: `astryx experimental theme editor new <name> --like neutral`, then `editor set <name> <thing> <value>` or `editor how "<what you want>"`; wire it with `astryx theme add <name>`; after each change look at it with `astryx experimental theme editor show <name> --png` (takes pictures of real components) and open the PNGs it writes; a theme change is not done until you have looked at the pictures. In code, extend an imported theme to customize it; `theme eject <slug>` only forks source. See `astryx docs theme`.
- SELF-CHECK: re-read the file; replace any className=, style={{…}}, raw <div>/<span>, imported .css/@apply, or hardcoded #hex/px with the component or the xstyle prop + a token.

`astryx help` lists every command. Key ones beyond the workflow:
search "<query>" find any component / hook / doc / template
discover <words> integrations you could add
docs <topic> getting-started, principles, tokens, theme … (`astryx docs` lists all)
docs cli commands and API reference
docs authoring build an integration package, and every field it holds
upgrade --from <old version> --apply run after a dependency bump
