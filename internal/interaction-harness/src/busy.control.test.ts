/**
 * @file busy.control.test.ts
 * @input Synthetic tracked frames (no browser)
 * @output The busy-main-thread verdict against a control: a component that
 *   moves on the control's frames passes through a stall the compositor itself
 *   makes, and a frozen one, or one the control outpaces by a single frame,
 *   still fails. Unchanged frames under one cast step a frame count as
 *   moved; a freeze, whose catch-up is more than one step, and a stall
 *   longer than the component's runs before it do not. Runs
 *   of a block too short to judge alone are judged pooled: the control over
 *   all of them, each run's stall against that run's control. A held
 *   animation is judged up to its curve's end. A stall before that end still
 *   fails, and a curve that ends too soon is named.
 * @position Unit test of ./busy's control judgment; the frames are
 *   busy.test.ts's fixtures, and the browser proof with a real compositor
 *   control is in harness.interaction.browser.spec.ts.
