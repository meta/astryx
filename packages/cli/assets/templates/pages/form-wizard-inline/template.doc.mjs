    'Accordion wizard stacking every step in one column: the active step expands in place while finished ones collapse to a single line carrying their result and a way back in. Steps that run themselves expand into a nested stepper that ticks check by check and halts the column where one fails. Best when later steps depend on what earlier ones decided.',
