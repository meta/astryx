 * @file GestureHost.ts
 * @input DOM touch, pointer, click, contextmenu, scroll and focus events of
 *   one document; elements with recognizers and consumers attached
 * @output Exports GestureHost (the DOM side of the gesture system) and
 *   getGestureHost (one host per document)
 * @position Browser adapter of packages/core/src/gestures: turns real events
 *   into GestureArena input, and carries out what the arena decides
 *
 * INPUT CHANNELS
 *
 * - Fingers begin and end with Touch Events: they are the only cancelable
 *   channel (a pointer event's preventDefault cannot stop a scroll or a
 *   click), and every event lists all the fingers at once. A
 *   finger's movement comes from BOTH its `touchmove`s and its
 *   `pointermove`s (paired at touchstart by target and position), the echo
 *   of one in the other dropped: Chromium sends no `touchmove` until a
 *   finger has travelled about 16 px, while a tap fails and a pan begins at
 *   10.
 * - A finger's events go to the element it landed on even after that
 *   element leaves the document, and then never reach the document. Each
 *   tracked finger's target therefore gets its own listeners, and a finger
 *   the events say is no longer down is cancelled, so a re-rendered or
 *   removed target never strands a gesture.
 * - Mice and pens come from Pointer Events, with coalesced samples for
 *   velocity. A pen on an iPad also produces `stylus` touches; those are left
 *   to the pointer path.
 * - `pointercancel` on a finger is the browser saying it took that finger
 *   for its own pan or zoom; so is a `touchmove` that can no longer be
 *   cancelled where `touch-action` let the browser pan, and a scroll above
 *   the touch.
 *
 * WHAT THE BROWSER IS TOLD
 *
 * - Each element gets the `touch-action` its recognizers leave the browser
 *   (touchAction.ts), never wider than the element's own value (a caller's
 *   explicit `touch-action` stays in force), set inline when they attach and
 *   restored when they detach.
 * - While a finger or a pen is down, text selection and the touch callout
 *   are off only where the hold does something (`spec:AST-094` FR41): on the
 *   elements of recognizers that bring a `selectionLock`, and on a non-text
 *   input under the finger inside them (WebKit's own style makes every
 *   input selectable); restored when the contact ends. Only where the
 *   primary pointer is coarse: a mouse never takes this lock, nor a finger
 *   or a pen where the primary pointer is fine.
 * - Each element with a recognizer that can claim a touch while it moves (a
 *   pan, a swipe, a long press that then drags, a pinch, a rotation) gets a
 *   NON-passive `touchmove` listener that cancels the event only while a
 *   recognizer owns one of its touches (a pan claims when it begins, at
 *   UIKit's 10 pt, `spec:AST-094` FR17). Nothing else is ever cancelled, so a
 *   touch nobody claims scrolls exactly as it would without the system. The
 *   known cost: a scroll that BEGINS on such an element waits for a busy main
 *   thread (measured in iOS Safari; a passive listener would hand every
 *   diagonal to the scroll instead). Elements whose recognizers only claim
 *   at the lift (taps), recognizers that never claim (`claimsTouches` false)
 *   and press consumers get no blocking listener, and the listener a
 *   finger's target gets at touch-down is passive for them too, so a scroll
 *   starting on them never waits.
 * - The browser took a finger on `pointercancel`, on its first uncancelable
 *   `touchmove` where it could pan, or on a scroll above it once the finger
 *   has travelled the slop; a scroll under a finger that has not moved is
 *   the page's own and leaves the touch alone.
 * - A lift whose click must not happen cancels its `touchend` (no click, no
 *   compatibility mouse events) and arms a one-shot swallower for the next
 *   trusted click; a click held for a recognizer that may still recognize is
 *   replayed if they all fail. Keyboard and assistive-technology clicks
 *   (`detail === 0`) always pass.
 * - A `contextmenu` while a recognizer owns a touch is cancelled, so a long
 *   press never also opens the browser's menu.
 *
 * SSR-safe: nothing touches `window` or `document` until something attaches.
 *
 * SYNC: When modified, update GestureHost.test.ts and README.md.
